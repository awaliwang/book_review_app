Book search app built with Flask. Utilizes Goodreads API to show ratings and number of ratings. App supports user registration, and users can leave reviews on available books.

Register to be a user first, then log into the app. Afterwards, user may search for a book. If the book exists in the database, the user can click on a link that brings them to a book page. The page will have information on the book, and a rating fetched from Goodreads API. The user can also leave a review, and see what other users have said.# book_review_app
